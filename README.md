---

A deprecated service that provided details about search reindex jobs and enabled the creation of a new job and triggering the reindex of data for Search Service. See [search service architecture docs here](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-search-api/tree/develop/architecture#search-service-architecture)

## Getting started

Run `make help` to see full list of make targets, otherwise read the following:

* Set up dependencies locally as follows:

In dp-compose repo run `docker-compose up -d` to run MongoDB on port 27017.

NB. The above command will also run Site Wide ElasticSearch, on port 11200, which is required by the Search API.

Run `vault server -dev` (this is required by Zebedee)

In the zebedee repo run `./run.sh` to run Zebedee

In the dp-search-api repo set the ELASTIC_SEARCH_URL environment variable as follows (to use the Site Wide ElasticSearch):

`export ELASTIC_SEARCH_URL="http://localhost:11200"`

Also in the dp-search-api repo run `make debug`

Make sure that you have a valid local SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable value;
if not then set one up by following these instructions: [zebedee](https://github.com/ONSdigital/zebedee)

* Then in the dp-search-reindex-api repo run `make debug`

### Dependencies

* Requires MongoDB running on port 27017
* Requires Kafka running on port 9092  
* Requires Zebedee running on port 8082
* Requires Search API running on port 23900  
* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`

### Testing

* Run the component tests with this command `go test -component`
* Run the unit tests with this command `make test`
* For all details of the service endpoints use a swagger editor [such as this one](https://editor.swagger.io/) to view the [swagger specification](swagger.yaml)

When running the service (see 'Getting Started') then one can use command line tool (cURL) or REST API client (e.g. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/)) to test the endpoints:

* POST: [search-reindex-jobs](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs) (should post a default job into the data store and return a JSON representation of it, should also create a new ElasticSearch index)
* GET: [http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID) NB. Use the id returned by the POST call above,e.g., [search-reindex-jobs](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs)bc7b87de-abf5-45c5-8e3c-e2a575cab28a (should get a job from the data store)
* GET: [search-reindex-jobs](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs) (should get all the jobs from the data store)
* GET: [http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs?offset=1&limit=2](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs?offset=1&limit=2) (should get no more than 2 jobs, from the data store, starting from index 1)
* PUT: [http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/number-of-tasks/10](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/number-of-tasks/10) (should put a value of 10 in the number_of_tasks field for the job with that particular id)
* GET: [http://localhost:25700/health](http://localhost:25700/health) (should show the health check details)
* POST: [http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/tasks](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/tasks) (should post a task into the data store and return a JSON representation of it) NB. This endpoint requires authorisation. Choose 'Bearer Token' as the authorisation type in Postman. The token to use can be found by this command `echo $SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN`
The endpoint also requires a body, which should contain the task name, and the number of documents e.g.
`{
"task_name": "dataset-api",
"number_of_documents": 29
}`
* GET: [http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/tasks/TASK_NAME](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/tasks/TASK_NAME) (should get a task from the data store)
* GET: [http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/tasks](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/ID/tasks) (should get all the tasks, for a particular job, from the data store)
* PATCH: [http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/41f72483-aeee-4693-9fed-a45ebaa370f2](http://localhost:25700/search-reindex-jobs/41f72483-aeee-4693-9fed-a45ebaa370f2) -H 'Authorization: Bearer fc4089e2e12937861377629b0cd96cf79298a4c5d329a2ebb96664c88df77b67' -H 'If-Match: *' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[{"op":"replace","path":"/state","value":"created"},{"op":"replace","path":"/total_search_documents","value":208},{"op":"replace","path":"/number-of-tasks","value":2}]'
